- Why:
  - Because, great apps.
  - Homegrown.
  - By and for cyclists, no map can compete!
- Basic mapping in OSM:
	- Explain OpenStreetMap (again).
		- COMMUNITY!!!
		- Hard because community, need to get used.
	- Create account.
		- Add first data.
		- Tracing from imagery.
		- Don't worry about making mistakes, there's an undo button and people to help.
	- Run through an entire example of correcting a mapping issue.
		- Cycling, strava or OSM Tracker or whatever.
		- Fix the issues you find, for example the one in vilvoorde.
	- run the workshop:
		-> example #1: http://mijndev.openstreetmap.nl/~ligfietser/fiets/index.html?map=surface&zoom=18&lat=51.17502&lon=4.45421&layers=TB000000TFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
			HOW: import GPX from strava, into the tool, move along try to find mistakes.
				- open iD, turn on mapillary.
		-> example #2: 
	- JOSM: do the same.
	- Other basic cycle mapping:
		- basic cycling options on residential streets (in iD).
		- mapping bicycle lanes.
		- surface tags (see mbt page).
		- facilities: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bicycle#Facilities
- What about the apps?
	- Cyclestreets: routing is pretty advanced, doesn't follow cycle routes.
	- OsmAnd: routing is again pretty advanced but a bit slow, has a map with cycle routes on it.
	- Maps.Me: More car-focused but works fast and very well.
	 
	All these apps use the data in a slightly different way, we map the data, everyone chooses how to use it on their own.
